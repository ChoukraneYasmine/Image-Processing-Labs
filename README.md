# Image Processing Labs

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of image processing labs that demonstrate various fundamental techniques using Python. Each lab explores different aspects of image processing, from basic manipulations to advanced filtering and morphological operations.

## Labs Overview

### **Lab 1: Introduction to Image Processing**
- Load and display an image.
- Convert images between different formats (PNG to JPG, TIFF).
- Extract and visualize individual color channels (Red, Green, Blue).
- Convert RGB images to grayscale and HSV color spaces.
- Create binary images and invert colors.

### **Lab 2: Image Filtering - Part 1**
- Add noise to images:
  - Salt and Pepper noise
  - Gaussian noise
- Apply different filtering techniques:
  - Gaussian filter
  - Median filter
  - High-pass filter
  - High-pass filter with averaging
  - Sharpening filter

### **Lab 3: Image Filtering - Part 2**
- Perform image translations (left and right shifts).
- Apply histogram equalization.
- Use edge detection techniques:
  - Sobel filter (X and Y directions)
- Implement various filters:
  - Low-pass filter
  - High-pass filter
- Perform morphological operations:
  - Dilation
  - Erosion
  - Closing
  - Opening
  - Morphological gradient
